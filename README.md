# Python Refresher for Data Science

This is an ongoing project consisting of Python notebooks for a learner with some basic understanding of the language. It is partly influenced by the book Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney and the LinkedIn Learning course [Python Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-data-structures-and-algorithms?u=2359714) by Robin Andrews; among other sources.
